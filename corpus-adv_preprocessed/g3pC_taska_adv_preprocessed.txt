in object-oriented programming, inheritance is a way to form new classes
instances of which are called objects using classes that have already
been defined.
inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a
relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. for
instance, a fruit is a generalization of apple, orange, mango
and many others. one can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple,
orange, etc. conversely, since apples are fruit i.e., an apple is-a
fruit, apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all
ruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant.
inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding replacing
one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to
those exposed by an ancestor.
