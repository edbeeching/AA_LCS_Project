pagerank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. . it is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. pagerank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size the pagerank computations require several passes, called iterations, through the collection to adjust approximate pagerank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value.
a probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1. a 0. 5 probability is commonly expressed as a 50% chance of something happening. hence, a pagerank of 0.5 means there is a 50% chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0.5 pagerank.

how pagerank works
assume a small universe of four web pages: a, b, c and d. the initial approximation of pagerank would be evenly divided between these four documents. hence, each document would begin with an estimated pagerank of 0.25.
in the original form of pagerank initial values were simply 1. this meant that the sum of all pages was the total number of pages on the web. later versions of pagerank see the below formulas would assume a probability distribution between 0 and 1. here were going to simply use a probability distribution hence the initial value of 0.25.
