pagerank pr refers to both the concept and the google system used
for ranking the importance of pages on the web. the pagerank of a
site refers to its importance or value on the web in relation to the
rest of the sites that have been pagerank ed.
the algorithm basically works like a popularity contest  if your site
is linked to by popular websites, then your site is considered more
popular. however, the pr doesnt just apply to the website as a whole
 different pages within a website get given different prs dependent
on a number of factors:
* inbound links backlinks  how many pages other than the ones on your website link to this particular page
* outbound links forward links  how many external pages the particular page links to
* dangling links  how many pages with no external links are linked to from a particular page
* deep links  how many links that are not the home page are linked to from a particular page
pr tries to emulate a random surfer . the algorithm includes a
dampening factor, which is the probability that a random surfer will
get bored and go and visit a new page - by default, this is 0.85. a
variation on this is the intentional surfer , where the importance of
a page is based on the actual visits to sites by users. this method is
used in the google toolbar, which reports back actual site visits to
google.
