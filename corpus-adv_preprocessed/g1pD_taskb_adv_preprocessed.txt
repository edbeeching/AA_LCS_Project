pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by the google internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the world wide web, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set. google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the internet this pagerank denotes a site s importance in the eyes of google. the pagerank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the richter scale. pagerank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. pagerank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. it is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. the pagerank computations require several passes, called iterations, through the collection to adjust approximate pagerank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value. a probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1. a 0.5 probability is commonly expressed as a 50% chance of something happening. hence, a pagerank of 0.5 means there is a 50% chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0.5 pagerank. the pagerank theory holds that even an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking. the probability, at any step, that the person will continue is a damping factor d. various studies have tested different damping factors, but it is generally assumed that the damping factor will be set around 0.85.
