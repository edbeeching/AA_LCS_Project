using the vector space model for information retrieval models all pages
and queries as high-dimensional sparse vectors. each item in the vector
represents a different keyword.
the similiarity betweeen two pages or a query and a page can be computed
using the dot product formula to find the cosine between them. this
represents the angle between them, but in n-dimensional space. results
will range from -1 to 1, with 1 being a close match. normally the vectors
will not have any negative values, so results will always be greater than
or equal to 0. the cosine is computed using: cos a = |a||b|a.b
