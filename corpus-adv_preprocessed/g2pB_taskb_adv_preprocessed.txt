the first thing to consider when talking about google s pagerank algorithm, is that a pagerank is essentially how important that web page is to the internet. so in essence it is a popularity contest between webpages.
originally search engines used highest keyword density, however this could be abused if keyword spamming was implemented. instead google uses a system that is based on sites linking to each other, e.g. the more important a site is that is linked to yours the higher your site will become. 
the algorithm google actually users is based on 4 factors, total number of pages, dampening factor, pagerank of a single page and the number of outbound links. a dampening factor is used to counter random surfers, who get bored and then switch to other pages. this formula is then re used until the results seem to converge together, to find the pagerank, so it is calculated iteratively.
pagerank is used by google to measure a popularity of the site and a number between 0 10 is assigned to each webpage depending on their pagerank. this allows google to calculate a marketing value for different webpages.
also it should be noted that the pagerank is periodically updated every 3 to 6 months, this is counter hackers influence on different pageranks.
