the pagerank algorithm is used to designate every aspect of a set of hyperlinked documents with a numerical weighting. it is used by the google search engine to estimate the relative importance of a web page according to this weighting. the system uses probability distribution to determine the odds that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any given page. following this, each web page is given a ranking of 0 10 according to its relevance to a search. the pagerank is calculated by taking into consideration the number of inbound links, and the pagerank of the pages supplying these links. this means therefore that if a webpage is linked to others that have a high ranking, then it too will receive a high rank. 
due to the nature of the pagerank system, it is susceptible to manipulation and has been exploited so that certain pages are given a false, exaggerated ranking. in these cases, only goggle has access to the genuine pagerank. however, much research has been conducted into methods of avoiding links from documents with a false pagerank to try and iron out the bugs in this system and from 2007 google has actively penalized schemes which try to increase rankings artificially.
