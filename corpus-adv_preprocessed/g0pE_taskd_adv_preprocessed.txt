Bayes Theorem is an important theorem relating conditional probabilities it allows us to calculate PROBA|B from PROBB|A Bayes Theorem is important because it can save us from gathering vast amounts of statistical evidence The main theory is PROBA|B = PROBB|A * PROBA PROBB it means Using PROBWIN|RAIN from earlier we can find the probability that it rained on a day that Harry won a race
