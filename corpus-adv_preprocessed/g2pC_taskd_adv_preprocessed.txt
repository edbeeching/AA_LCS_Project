In probability theory Bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events It is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations
Bayes theorem is expressed mathematically as:
PA|B = PB|APAPB
where PA|B is the conditional probability of A given B PA is the prior probability of A PB is the prior probability of B and PB|A is the conditional probability of B given A 
Bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events PA and PB and is valid in all common interpretations of probability For example in a school in made up of 35 boys and 25 girls the girls wear skirts of trousers in equal numbers and the boys all wear trousers If a student is observed from a distance wearing trousers Bayes theorem can be used to determine the probability of this student being a girl 
PA is the probability of the student being a girl which is 25 
PB|A is the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a girl which is 05 
PB is the probability of a random student wearing trousers which can be calculated as PB = PB|APA + PB|APA where  denotes a complementary event which is 08 
Therefore the probability using the formula is 025 
Bayes theorem is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations for instance the probability that a proposed medical diagnosis is correct given certain observed symptoms
