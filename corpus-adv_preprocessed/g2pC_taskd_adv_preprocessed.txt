in probability theory, bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. it is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations.
bayes theorem is expressed mathematically as:
pa|b = pb|apapb
where pa|b is the conditional probability of a given b, pa is the prior probability of a, pb is the prior probability of b, and pb|a is the conditional probability of b given a. 
bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events pa and pb, and is valid in all common interpretations of probability. for example, in a school in made up of 35 boys and 25 girls, the girls wear skirts of trousers in equal numbers and the boys all wear trousers. if a student is observed from a distance wearing trousers, bayes theorem can be used to determine the probability of this student being a girl. 
pa is the probability of the student being a girl which is 25. 
pb|a is the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a girl, which is 0.5 
pb is the probability of a random student wearing trousers, which can be calculated as pb = pb|apa + pb|apa where  denotes a complementary event, which is 0.8. 
therefore the probability using the formula is 0.25. 
bayes theorem is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations, for instance the probability that a proposed medical diagnosis is correct, given certain observed symptoms.
