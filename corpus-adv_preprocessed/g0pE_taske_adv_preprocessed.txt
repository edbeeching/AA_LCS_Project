dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure described below. the method takes much less time than naive methods. the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all, and instead comes from the term mathematical programming, a synonym for optimization. thus, the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced. for instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.
