 in probability theory, bayes theorem often called bayes law after rev thomas bayes relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. it is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations. for example, a patient may be observed to have certain symptoms. bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct, given that observation.
as a formal theorem, bayes theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability. however, it plays a central role in the debate around the foundations of statistics: frequentist and bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications. 
suppose there is a co-ed school having 60% boys and 40% girls as students. the girl students wear trousers or skirts in equal numbers the boys all wear trousers. an observer sees a random student from a distance all they can see is that this student is wearing trousers. what is the probability this student is a girl the correct answer can be computed using bayes theorem.
the event a is that the student observed is a girl, and the event b is that the student observed is wearing trousers. to compute pa|b, we first need to know:
pb|a, or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a boy. this is given as 1.
pa, or the probability that the student is a girl regardless of any other information. since the observers sees a random student, meaning that all students have the same probability of being observed, and the fraction of girls among the students is 40%, this probability equals 0.4.
pa, or the probability that the student is a boy regardless of any other information a is the complementary event to a. this is 60%, or 0.6.
pb|a, or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a girl. as they are as likely to wear skirts as trousers, this is 0.5
