the pagerank is a recursive algorithm used by google to determine which webpages are more important than others. the algorithm considers the importance of a webpage to be reflected by how many other webpages link to that page, and the importance of those pages.
for each page that links to a page a, the pagerank between zero and one is calculated iteratively according to the following two key factors: the probability of a user navigating away from a page randomly the pagerank of any page that links to a, divided by the total number of outbound links from that page. this assumes that a link among many outbound links is less valuable than a link among fewer outbound links. a variation of the pagerank method bases the importance of a webpage on how many visits the page gets. 
the method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a sites pagerank. however, it is still a good indicator for search engines to use as a variable in deciding on the most appropriate results according to a query.
