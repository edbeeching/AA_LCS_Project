Bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of
two random events For example a person may be seen to have certain
medical symptoms Bayes theorem can then be used to compute the
probability that given that observation the proposed diagnosis is
the right one
Bayes theorem forms a relationship between the probabilities xcof
events A and B Intuitively Bayes theorem in this form describes the
way in which ones recognition of A are updated by having observed
B
PA | B = PB | A PA  PB
PA|B is the conditional probability of A given B It is derived from or depends upon the specified value of B therefore it is also known as the posterior probability
PB|A is the conditional probability of B given A
PA is the prior probability A It doesnt take into account any information about B so it is prior
PB is the prior or marginal probability of B and acts to normalise the probability
To derive the theorem we begin with the definition of conditional
probability By combining and re-arranging these two equations for A
and B we get a the lemma called product rule for
probabilities Provided that PB is not a zero dividing both sides
by PB renders us with Bayes theorem
