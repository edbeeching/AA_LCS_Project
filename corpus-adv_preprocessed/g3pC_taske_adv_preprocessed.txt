in computer science and mathematics, dynamic programming
is a method of problem solving that utilises the properties
of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. and thus
the method takes much less time than more naive methods.
in dynamic programming, the word programming has no
real connection to computer programming at all, it actually
comes from the term mathematical programming,
a synonym for optimisation. thus, the program is the optimal
plan of action that is being produced. for example, a
schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a
programme. programming, in this sense, means finding an
acceptable plan, an algorithm.
