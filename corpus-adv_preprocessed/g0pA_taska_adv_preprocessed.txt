inheritance is a basic concept of object-oriented programming where
the basic idea is to create new classes that add extra detail to
existing classes. this is done by allowing the new classes to reuse
the methods and variables of the existing classes and new methods and
classes are added to specialise the new class. inheritance models the
 is-kind-of relationship between entities or objects, for example,
postgraduates and undergraduates are both kinds of student. this kind
of relationship can be visualised as a tree structure, where student 
would be the more general root node and both postgraduate and
 undergraduate would be more specialised extensions of the student 
node or the child nodes. in this relationship student would be
known as the superclass or parent class whereas, postgraduate would
be known as the subclass or child class because the postgraduate 
class extends the student class.
inheritance can occur on several layers, where if visualised would
display a larger tree structure. for example, we could further extend
the postgraduate node by adding two extra extended classes to it
called, msc student and phd student as both these types of student
are kinds of postgraduate student. this would mean that both the msc
student and phd student classes would inherit methods and variables
from both the postgraduate and student classes .
