in object oriented programming, inheritance is the ability to specify one class to be a subclass of another this leads to a hierarchy of classes, with the child classes inheriting and specialising   and sometimes adding to   the functionality and data structures of the parent classes. the hierarchy that is formed is also useful for the organisation of classes and objects, as it defines a relationship between the child and the parent the child class is a kind of the parent class. inheritance is useful for situations where several classes share common features, such as needed functions or data variables. in addition to this, child classes can be referenced in terms of their parent classes, which can be useful when storing large data structures of objects of several classes, which can all be referenced as one base class. inheritance is a core aspect of object oriented programming, and is available in some form or another in most, if not all, object oriented languages available today. most of these languages provide an extend keyword, which is used to subclass another. also, the functions and data variables that are inherited by the subclasses can be controlled through the use of visibility modifiers.
