bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events and is named after the reverend thomas bayes 1702 1761, who studied how to compute a distribution for the parameter of a binomial distribution. it is valid in all common interpretations of probability. it plays a central role in the debate around the foundations of statistics: frequentist and bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications. frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of occurrence or to subsets of populations as proportions of the whole, while bayesians describe probabilities in terms of beliefs and degrees of uncertainty. applications of bayes theorem often assume the philosophy underlying bayesian probability that uncertainty and degrees of belief can be measured as probabilities. one of bayes results proposition 5 gives a simple description of conditional probability, and shows that it can be expressed independently of the order in which things occur:
if there be two subsequent events, the probability of the second bn and the probability of both together pn, and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened, from hence i guess that the first event has also happened, the probability i am right [i.e., the conditional probability of the first event being true given that the second has also happened] is pb. 
note that the expression says nothing about the order in which the events occurred it measures correlation, not causation.
