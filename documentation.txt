function make_array(file1)
input : filename
output : list of words in file 
* the first element in the output array is an empty string.
* this is done because the LCS algorithm assumes base-1 indexing

function make_sentence_array(file1)
input : filename
output : list of lists of words. Each list of words is a sentence.
*indexing note from above applies

function make_compsentence_array(file1)
input : filename
output : list of words in file, with punctuation removed.
*indexing note applies
*This function is needed to compute the sentence by sentence LCS

function LCSclassic(X,Y)
input : 2 lists of words
output: list of words in LCS
*classic dynammic programming algorithm

function LCS(file1,file2,mode)
input : 2 file names, mode 
output : length of first array, length of LCS, list of words in LCS
*This is a driver (helper) function for LCS. The idea is once the other LCS
algorithms have been implemented, the argument "mode" can be which algorithm

function LCS_Sentence(file1,file2,mode)
input : 2 file names, mode
output : length of first array, length of LCS, list of words in LCS
*This is the same as the LCS function except it's using sentence by sentence 
processing. The idea is the same, once other algorithms have been implemented,
the user can do sentence by sentence using any of the algorithms, specified by mode.

function LCS_list(b,X,m,n,S)
input: b matrix from dynammic programming alg, list of words for the file,
length of X (m), length of second text (n), and S is the LCS words which it builds
output: S, filled with words of LCS
*This is the recursive function to build the LCS from the b matrix. It should
only work for the dynammic programming algorithm, since it needs the b matrix.
