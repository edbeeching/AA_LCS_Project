a dynamic is method problem problems programming recursive solves solving which. an and as commonly derived dynamic from hence is is is less mathematical method methods much na of optimal optimisation, problems programming programming referred solving takes term than the the time to ve which. 
dynamic algorithm an and create memoization of optimal overlapping problems programming properties solve subproblems substructure, such the to to uses. be can find is made means of of optimal overall problem problem problems solution structure sub substructure that the the the the to to up used which. a be different larger many may means overlapping problem problems same solve subproblems subproblems that the to used with. a being by case constant divided each in into is is is problem reached solvable solved sub sub subproblems, time until which. already been computation computed have in memoization order re reduce solutions stores to unnecessary which.
