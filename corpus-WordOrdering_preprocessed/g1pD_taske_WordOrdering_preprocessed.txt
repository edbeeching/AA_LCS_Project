a and dynamic faster is make memoization method of of optimal overlapping problems problems programming solving sub substructure, that use. a a algorithm computer finding has instead is it it no of process programming relationship satisfactory to. 
optimal find is of optimal optional overall problem problems process solution solutions sub substructure the the the the to to to using. be bigger can have is it overlapping problem problems problems said same solutions solve sub sub the to to used various when. are be in is memoization order rather recomputed save solutions stored than the time to used. a a a advance are be be be can can cases computed disposed future in in it longer no of once positive problem required, solution solution some that to we will.
