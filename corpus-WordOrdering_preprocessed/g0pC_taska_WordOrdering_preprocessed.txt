a allready been class classes defined formed have in inheritance is is new object oriented programming using where which. and attributes behavior classes classes existent from have have in inherited it of some that the the these where which. code existing in inheritance is minimize modification object of of oriented peropos programming reuse the the to without.
inheritance allowes be catagorize categorized, classes humans similer the to to way. a a also between classes du generalize is it provides relationship the to to way. & a a animal are cheaters cow example for generalization is of pigs similarly so. all all allows and animals animals are attributes behaviours cheaters class, classes commen commen defeining define in in inheart natuarly one properities so this to to to us way, which would.
the , advantage alot can classes code code, complexity have inheritance instead is of of of otherwise program reducing same shair similar that the the the thus which would. also are as be by can code code control controled inheritance, is many of pieces polymorphism refered shared therefore, to where which.
inheritance accomplished adding ancestor, be by by can in its methods methods new or overriding.
