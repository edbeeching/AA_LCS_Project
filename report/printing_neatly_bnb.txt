Printing neatly branch and bound

Two branch and bound methods were compared, in both cases an initial estimate of the upper bound
was evaluated using the the cost of a greedy approach. The first method then evaluates solutions in the same manner as the recursive, but when the cost of the current branch exceeds the bound given by the greedy solution, the recusion is cut and the algorithm back-tracks. The second algorithm makes an estimate of the cost of the remaining solution by using a greedy approach to find the cost of any remaining words, this enables to algorithm to cut potentially worse solutions early. The second approach is faster than the dynamic approach but unfortunately does not alway produce an optimal solution.
