Plagarism Detection

Our method of detecting plagarism uses the LCS that was found between two texts, and combines two types
of comparisons between the LCS and the text in question to determine if the text was plagarized or not.

First, we compute how many words in the LCS appear next to each other in the original text. This is done 
because texts that are copied are more likely to have copied words next to each other, as opposed to texts 
that aren't copied and just have similar words. Our function computes the square of the number of words 
that are adjacent to eachother (one word alone is 1, two words next to eachother would be 4), divides this 
number of by the square of the length of the text to obtain a ratio (a ratio of 1 would mean cut and paste)
and then returns the square root of this number.

Second, we compute the ratio of sentences in the text that have a percentage of plagarism higher than a 
certain threshold. This threshold is an argument to the function and can change. We have found that an optimal 
threshold is 70%, meaning this function returns the ratio of sentences in the text that are more than 70% 
plagarized. However, the user can change the threshold depending on how much time they have to check a text,
for example. A lower threshold will result in higher plagarism scores, and more texts to examine for potential 
plagarism. 

Finally, we combine these two results to form the suggestion on if the text is plagarized or not. First, we compute 
a combined threshold for the sum of both metrics. We have found through experimentation that all the texts in the 
corpus that are not plagarized have combined scores of less than 0.2 out of 1. Thus, we set our threshold sum as 0.2.
Next, we compute the combined plagarism score for a text by adding the first metric to the second.
We then return whether or not this combined score is higher than the combined score threshold.
