# AA_LCS_Project
MLDM Semester 1 Advanced Algorithms project.

To do list: (please add stuff!)

* Text Pre-processing 
* LCS Classic - Forwards
* LCS Classic - Backwards
* LCS Dynamic
* LCS B & B (we have no learnt this yet but if anyone knows this approach?)
* Printing neatly (there are several techniques so this task may expand)
* Run Time and space complexity tests and analysis
* Comparisons on the corpus
* Technique for plagarism score for the LCS
* User Interface ??
* More clever pre-processing / post processing
* Report
* Presentation for defense
