in probability theory, bayes theorem called bayes law rev thomas bayes relates conditional marginal probabilities random events. compute posterior probabilities observations. example, patient observed symptoms. bayes theorem compute probability proposed diagnosis correct, observation. example 2 as formal theorem, bayes theorem valid common interpretations probability., plays central role debate foundations statistics: frequentist bayesian interpretations disagree ways probabilities assigned applications. frequentists assign probabilities random events frequencies occurrence subsets populations proportions, bayesians describe probabilities terms beliefs degrees uncertainty. articles bayesian probability frequentist probability discuss debates greater detail. bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities events, vanishing probability: pa|b = \frac{pb | a\, pa}{pb}. each term bayes theorem conventional name: * pa prior probability marginal probability. prior sense account. * pa|b conditional probability,. called posterior probability derived depends. * pb|a conditional probability. * pb prior marginal probability, acts normalizing constant. intuitively, bayes theorem form describes beliefs observing updated observed.
