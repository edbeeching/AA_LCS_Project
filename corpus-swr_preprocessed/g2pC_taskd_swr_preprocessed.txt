in probability theory, bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities random events. compute posterior probabilities observations. bayes theorem expressed mathematically as: pa|b = pb|apapb where pa|b conditional probability, pa prior probability, pb prior probability, pb|a conditional probability. bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities random events pa pb, valid common interpretations probability. example, school 35 boys 25 girls, girls wear skirts trousers equal numbers boys wear trousers. student observed distance wearing trousers, bayes theorem determine probability student girl. pa probability student girl 25. pb|a probability student wearing trousers student girl, 0.5 pb probability random student wearing trousers, calculated pb = pb|apa pb|apa denotes complementary event, 0.8. therefore probability formula 0.25. bayes theorem compute posterior probabilities observations, instance probability proposed medical diagnosis correct, observed symptoms.
