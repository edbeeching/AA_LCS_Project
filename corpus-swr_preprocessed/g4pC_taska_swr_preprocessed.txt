in object oriented programming, inheritance form classes instances called objects classes defined. inheritance concept invented 1967 simula inheritance support representation categorization computer languages. categorization powerful mechanism number processing, crucial human learning generalization cognitive economy stored specific entity, particularities. the classes, derived classes, inherit attributes behavior pre existing classes, referred base classes ancestor classes. intended help reuse existing code modification. inheritance called generalization, relationships represent hierarchy classes objects. instance, fruit generalization apple, orange, mango. consider fruit abstraction apple, orange,. conversely, apples fruit.e., apple fruit, apples naturally inherit properties common fruit, fleshy container seed plant. an advantage inheritance modules interfaces share lot code, reducing complexity program. inheritance view, dual, called polymorphism, describes pieces code controlled shared control code. inheritance typically accomplished overriding replacing methods exposed ancestor, adding methods exposed ancestor. complex inheritance, inheritance design mature, lead yo yo problem.
