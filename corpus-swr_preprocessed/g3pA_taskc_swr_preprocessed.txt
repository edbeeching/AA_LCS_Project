vector space model, term vector model, algebraic model representing objects text documents vectors identifiers example, terms. retrieval filtering, indexing relevancy rankings, smart retrieval system. a document represented vector, dimension corresponding separate term. term occurs document, will vector. ways computing values aka term weights developed best schemes tf idf weighting. the term defined depends application. typically, terms single, keywords, longer phrases. chosen terms, number dimensions vector number distinct corpus. relevancy ranks documents, keyword search, calculated assumptions document similarities theory, comparing difference angles document vector original query vector, query represented format vector documents. generally, easier calculate cosine angle vectors angle. cosine indicates query document vector orthogonal match query term exist document considered. however, vector space model limitations. long documents represented poor similarity values small scalar product large dimensionality search keywords match precisely document terms word substrings result false positive match context documents term vocabulary associated, leading false negative match order terms appear document represented vector space model.
