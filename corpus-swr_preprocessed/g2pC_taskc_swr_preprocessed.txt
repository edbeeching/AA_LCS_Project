in vector space model vsm, documents form bags standard retrieval approach represents documents mathematical bag structure, recording terms occur. the vector space model retrieval determine documents, documents search query. in collection documents, document viewed vector values terms document, term axis. queries represented vectors vector space model, deciding document matches query closest matter selecting document vector nearest query vector. the query vector compared document vector turn vector similarity measure, cosine angle query vector document vector. this equation calculated dividing dot product query vector document vector modulus query vector multiplied modulus document vector. denominator takes account differences length vector, normalising length. whichever document returns highest cosine similarity score considered closest matching document query.
