in mathematics computer science, dynamic programming method solving problems, exhibit properties overlapping subproblems optimal substructure. method takes time naive methods. the term originally 1940s describe process solving problems find best decisions. the field founded systems analysis engineering topic recognized ieee the word programming dynamic programming connection computer programming, term mathematical programming, synonym optimization., program optimal plan action produced. instance, finalized schedule events exhibition called program. programming, sense, finding acceptable plan action, algorithm. optimal substructure optimal solutions subproblems find optimal solutions problem. example, shortest path goal vertex graph computing shortest path goal adjacent vertices, pick best path. in general, solve problem optimal substructure three step process: break problem smaller subproblems. solve problems optimally three step process recursively. use optimal solutions construct optimal solution original problem. the subproblems,, solved dividing subproblems,, reach simple case solvable constant time.
