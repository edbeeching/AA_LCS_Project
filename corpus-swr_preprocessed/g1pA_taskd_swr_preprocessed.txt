bayes theorem relates conditional marginal probabilities random events named reverend thomas bayes 1702 1761, studied compute distribution parameter binomial distribution. valid common interpretations probability. plays central role debate foundations statistics: frequentist bayesian interpretations disagree ways probabilities assigned applications. frequentists assign probabilities random events frequencies occurrence subsets populations proportions, bayesians describe probabilities terms beliefs degrees uncertainty. applications bayes theorem assume philosophy underlying bayesian probability uncertainty degrees belief measured probabilities. bayes proposition 5 simple description conditional probability, expressed independently order things occur: if subsequent events, probability second bn probability pn, discovered second event happened, guess event happened, probability [i.e., conditional probability event true second happened] pb. note expression order events occurred measures correlation, causation.
