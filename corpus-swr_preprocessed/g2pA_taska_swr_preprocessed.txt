inheritance allows programs developed object orientated language reuse code replicated unnecessarily program. to achieve, programmer note generalisations similarities aspects program. for example, program exist model forms transport. glance, car train common. abstractly, will speed travelling, direction, current position. methods utilising data high inheritance hierarchy, example transport class. example method works position train travelling minutes direction. likewise, to find object type car. inheritance method defined superclass train car classes, car train object utilise. the train car subclasses extend transport class, will additional characteristics don share..g. passenger capacity class variable car train values, train methods lines toilet engaged . if wanted add additional forms transport, aeroplane, toilet engaged function. extended hierarchy, mass transport class extends transport class. train aeroplane, inherit characteristics super classes.
