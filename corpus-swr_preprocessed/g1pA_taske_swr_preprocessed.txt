dynamic programming algorithmic technique solve optimization problems object find best solution number possibilities. called bottom approach, meaning problem solved set problems turn sub problems.sub problems selected solve problem. problems solved solutions saved will recalculated. whilst calculated individually, overlap. problem met, solve problem. searches possibilities, accurate. method efficient recalculating considerably reduces computation. computer science applied example, compress data high density bar codes. dynamic programming effective objects ordered left order rearranged. works well character chains example.
