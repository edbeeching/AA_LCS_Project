when talk inheritance object oriented programming languages, concept invented 1967 simula, talking form classes classes instances called objects involve classes defined. derived classes intended help reuse existing code modification classes inherit attributes behavior pre existing classes, referred base classes ancestor classes. categorization computer languages powerful number processing inheritance support representation categorization., fundamental helping humans learn generalization specific entities applied wider group belongs relation established cognitive processing involves acquired stored specific entity, actual fact particularities. an instance fruit generalization apple, orange, mango. inheritance referred generalization, relationships represent hierarchy classes objects. considered fruit abstraction apple, orange,. conversely, apples fruit, naturally inherit properties common fruit, fleshy container seed plant. modules similarities interfaces share lot code reducing complexity program. advantages inheritance. inheritance view, dual, describes parts code control shared control code, named polymorphism. on hand, inheritance accomplished replacing methods exposed ancestor, adding methods exposed ancestor. well term replacing called overriding.
