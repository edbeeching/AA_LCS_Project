in mathematics computer science, dynamic programming method solving problems exhibit properties overlapping problems optimal substructure. term originally 1940s richard bellman describe process solving problems find best decisions. 1953, refined modern meaning. bellmans contribution remembered the bellman equation, central result dynamic programming restates optimization problem recursive form. word programming dynamic programming connection computer programming, term mathematical programming, synonym optimization., program optimal plan action produced. instance, finalized schedule events exhibition called program. programming, sense, finding acceptable plan action, algorithm. dynamic programming takes approaches, top approach, problem broken problems, problems solved solutions remembered, case solved. recursion memorization combined bottom approach, problems needed solved advance build solutions larger problems. approach better stack space number function calls, intuitive figure problems needed solving problem. some programming languages automatically memorize result function call set arguments, order speed call. languages portably.g. scheme, common lisp perl, special extensions.this referentially transparent function.
