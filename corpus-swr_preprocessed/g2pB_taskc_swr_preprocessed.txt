a vector space model algebraic model representing text documents vectors identifiers. vector space model retrieval filtering. vector space models indexing rank relevancy differing documents. to explain vector space models, basically document characterized vector. separate term corresponding differing dimensions. multiple ways compute values vector space models recognised tf idf weighting. the differing application direct influence definition term. normal term single word, keywords longer phrases. number unique vocabulary denotes dimensionality, terms. however whilst vector space modelling 4 key problems, order terms lost, keywords precise searched, bigger documents poor similarity represented documents based topic won associated term vocabulary differs.
