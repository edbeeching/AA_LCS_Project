there large number models solving problem retrieval based three mathematical bases: set theory, algebra probabilistic. vector space model methods, algebraic model. in vector space model document represented vector. vector, dimension corresponds separate term term typically single word, keyword phrase. term doesn occur document, vector. term occurs document,. to calculate relevant document keyword search cosine angle vectors easier calculate actual angle. the vector space model,, limitations: small similarity values, long documents represented order matter false positive matches brought terms contained documents match semantics return false negative matches. number models based extend vector space model, designed eradicate problems.
