the probability event happening considering likelihood number instance occurring, dividing total number events. equation calculation follows: probability = number instance total number events on hand probability theory involves assigning values events. example: p=1: event occur p=0: event occur p=0.5: event occurs half time. there conditional probability interested variables relate. bayes theorem theorem relating conditional probabilities understanding probability theory true, piece evidence. wide variety contexts, ranging marine biology development bayesian spam blockers email systems.
