dynamic programming powerful mathematical technique, utilised programming, solving optimization problems., minimizing maximizing. greedy algorithms focus making best local choice decision making stage. proof correctness, algorithm fail. dynamic programming, design algorithm searches possibilities ensures correctness whilst storing avoid recomputed leading computational efficiency. dynamic programming solves problems combining solutions subproblems. subproblems,, independent. subproblems share subsubproblems, solution subproblem doesn affect solutions subproblems stemming problem. dynamic programming reduces computation time solving subproblems bottom. stores solution subproblem time solved, meaning solution subproblem encountered subsequently. the key dynamic programming find structure optimal solutions. steps required follows: generalise structure optimal solution recursively define optimal solution compute optimal solution values top caching, bottom table generate optimal solution computed values
