using vector space model retrieval models pages and queries high dimensional sparse vectors. item vector represents keyword. the similiarity betweeen query computed using dot product formula find cosine. this represents angle, dimensional space. results will range 1 1, 1 close match. vectors will negative values, will greater than or equal 0. cosine computed using: cos = |a||b|a.b
