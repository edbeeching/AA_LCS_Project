in field computer science, term dynamic programming relates style programming breaks large problem smaller subproblems, generally allows finding optimal solution. problem split subproblems, split smaller problems,, reduced. it common dynamic programming recursion, saving previous faster computation leads higher efficiency, calculations redone. example, problem reduced problems, reduced, common subsubproblems, calculation result saved help solve subproblem. an example gain efficiency path finding problem. distinct routes network 10 nodes, tagged, routes share common, nodes, cost calculated route saved., second route processed, cost to calculated. in general, dynamic programming optimisation problems, efficient solution needed. areas sort programming ai, computer graphics, compression routines, biomedical applications.
