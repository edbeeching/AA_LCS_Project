dynamic programming problem solving method solves recursive problems. term derived mathematical programming commonly referred optimisation, dynamic programming optimal method solving problems takes time ve methods. dynamic programming properties optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems memoization create algorithm solve problems. optimal substructure structure problem problems find solution problem. problem overlapping subproblems subproblems solve larger problems. problem solved divided subproblems, case reached solvable constant time. memoization stores solutions computed order reduce unnecessary computation. dynamic programming divided main approaches: top bottom. top approach breaks problem subproblems, solved remembered, combination memoization recursion. bottom approach solves subproblems advance, solutions build solutions bigger problem.
