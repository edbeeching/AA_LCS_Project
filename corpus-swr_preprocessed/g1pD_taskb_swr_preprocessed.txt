pagerank link analysis algorithm google internet search engine assigns numerical weighting element hyperlinked set documents, wide web, purpose measuring relative set. google assigns numeric weighting 0 10 webpage internet pagerank denotes site eyes google. pagerank derived theoretical probability logarithmic scale richter scale. pagerank probability distribution represent likelihood person randomly clicking links will arrive. pagerank calculated collections documents size. assumed papers distribution evenly divided documents collection the computational process. pagerank computations require passes, called iterations, collection adjust approximate pagerank values closely reflect theoretical true. probability expressed numeric 0 1. 0.5 probability commonly expressed 50% chance happening., pagerank 0.5 50% chance person clicking random link will directed document 0.5 pagerank. pagerank theory holds imaginary surfer randomly clicking links will eventually clicking. probability, step, person will continue damping factor. studies tested damping factors, generally assumed damping factor will set 0.85.
