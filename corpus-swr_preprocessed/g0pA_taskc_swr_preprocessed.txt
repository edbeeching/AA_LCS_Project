the vector space model called, term vector model algebraic model represent text documents, well objects general, vectors identifiers. retrieval smart retrieval system. a document represented vector dimension corresponds separate term. term appears document vector. ways calculating values, term weights, developed. best methods called tf idf weighting. the definition term depends application generally terms single, keywords, longer phrases. chosen terms, dimensionality vector number vocabulary, number distinct occurring corpus. the vector space model disadvantages. firstly, long documents represented badly poor similarity values. secondly, search keywords accurately match document terms substrings result false positive match. thirdly, documents context term vocabulary will associated, false negative match. finally, order terms appear document lost vector space representation.
