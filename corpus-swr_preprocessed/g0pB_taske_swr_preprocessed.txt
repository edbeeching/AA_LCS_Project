dynamic programming method solving mathematical programming problems exhibit properties overlapping subproblems optimal substructure. quicker method naive methods. word programming dynamic programming relates optimization, commonly referred mathematical programming. richard bellman originally coined term 1940s describe method solving problems find best decisions, 1953, refined method current modern meaning. optimal substructure splitting programming optimal solutions subproblems, find optimal solutions problem. example computing shortest path goal vertex graph., compute shortest path goal adjacent vertices.,, best path, demonstrating dynamic programming principle. general three step process solve problem: break problem smaller subproblems. recursively three step process compute optimal path subproblem. construct optimal solution, computed optimal subproblems, original problem. this process continues recursively, working subproblems dividing subproblems, simple case reached easily solvable.
