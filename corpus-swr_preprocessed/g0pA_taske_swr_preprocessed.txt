dynamic programming algorithm design technique optimisation problems, minimising maximising. divide conquer, dynamic programming solves problems combining solutions problems., divide conquer, problems independent problems share sub problems solution problem affect solutions problems problem. there steps dynamic programming: characterise structure optimal solution. define optimal solution recursively. compute optimal solution values top caching bottom table. construct optimal solution computed values. an example type problem dynamic programming is: sequences, x=x1,...,xm y=y1,...,yn find common subsequence length maximum. dynamic programming reduces computation solving problems bottom fashion storing solution problem time solved., solution problem encountered helps reduce computation., key dynamic programming determine structure optimal solutions.
