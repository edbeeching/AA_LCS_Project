in mathematics computer science, dynamic programming method solving problems exhibit properties overlapping subproblems optimal substructure. the word programming dynamic programming connection computer programming, term mathematical programming, synonym optimization. programming, sense, finding acceptable plan action, algorithm. optimal substructure optimal solutions subproblems find optimal solutions problem. general, solve problem optimal substructure three step process: break problem smaller subproblems. solve problems optimally three step process recursively. use optimal solutions construct optimal solution original problem. the subproblems,, solved dividing subproblems,, reach simple case solvable constant time. to problem overlapping subproblems subproblems solve larger problems. example, fibonacci sequence, f3 = f1 f2 f4 = f2 f3 computing number involves computing f2. f3 f4 needed compute f5, naive approach computing f5 computing f2. applies overlapping subproblems present: naive approach waste time recomputing optimal solutions subproblems solved. in order avoid, save solutions problems solved., solve problem, retrieve reuse computed solution. we solution, throw save space. cases, compute solutions subproblems well advance. dynamic programming of: overlapping subproblems optimal substructure memoization dynamic programming takes approaches: top approach bottom approach
