in vector space model, documents retrieved represented vectors. term weighting indentifies success failure vector space method. terms basically indexing unit identify contents text., term weighting scheme plays role similarity measure. similarity measures identify retrieval efficiency retrieval system. depends formulas. formulas depend frequencies document depend inter document frequencies. main components formulas follows: binary: binary formula word appears document equal relevance. number times word appears considered. term frequency: this formula counts times term occurs document. times term occurs document relevant document., favors common long documents. formula credit appears frequently, credit. augmented normalized term frequency this formula credit word appears additional credit appear frequently. logarithmic term frequency logarithms de emphasize e_ect frequency. literature proposes log alternate log used
