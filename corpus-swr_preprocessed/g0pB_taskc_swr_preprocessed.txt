vector space model algebraic model representing text documents general, objects vectors identifiers,, example, terms. smart retrieval system. filtering, retrieval, indexing relevancy rankings. a document represented vector, dimension corresponds separate term. term occurs document, vector. ways computing values, term weights, developed. definition term depends application. typically terms single, keywords, longer phrases. chosen terms, dimensionality vector number vocabulary number distinct occurring corpus. one best schemes tf idf weighting, proposed salton, wong yang. classic vector space model, term specific weights document vectors products local global parameters. relevancy rankings documents keyword search calculated, assumptions document similarities theory, comparing deviation angles document vector original query vector query represented kind vector documents. the vector space model limitations: * search keywords precisely match document terms word substrings result false positive match * semantic sensitivity documents context term vocabulary associated, false negative match * order terms appear document lost vector space representation * long documents represented poor similarity values small scalar product large dimensionality.
