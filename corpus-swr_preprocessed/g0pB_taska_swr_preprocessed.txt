inheritance basic concept object oriented programming. models reuse existing class code classes kind relationship. for example, house kind building, office block kind building. house office block will inherit characteristics buildings, personal characteristics house number occupants, office block will number offices., personal characteristics dont apply types buildings. in example, building considered superclass general characteristics objects inherit house office block subclasses specific types specialise characteristics superclass. java allows object inheritance. class inherits class, public variables methods subclass. public class shape { private color colour public void setcolourcolor newcolour{ colour = newcolour } } public class circle extends shape { private int radius public void setradiusint newradius{ radius = newradius } } in example, circle class subclass shape class. shape class public setcolour method, will circle class subclasses shape., private variable colour defined shape class will direct manipulation circle class inherited. circle class specialises shape class, setradius circle class subclasses circle, isnt superclass shape.
